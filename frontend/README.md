# Tick Tack Toe - Frontend

The frontend for my Tick Tack Toe application. It is built with the [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/) game library, and uses
[Apache HttpClient](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-5.2.x/) for REST calls and [Spring's](https://spring.io)
Websocket components for realtime communication. I have much prior experience with libGDX, but due to time constraints
with the project, some of the code is not optimal and relatively unpolished.

## Running

Run the project with the [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) task `application/run` or download a runnable jar file from
[Releases](../releases) and run it. The project requires Java 17 or newer and Windows, Linux or Mac OS X with OpenGL 2.0
ES support to run.
